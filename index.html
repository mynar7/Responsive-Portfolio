                <p>Creativity is important to me. I spend a lot of time thinking about what I can make, write, or build next. That's why I decided to pursue a career in website development. If I could spend my day flexing my creative brain cells for profit, I don't think I'd ever "work" another day in my life.</p><br>

                <p>I started my coding career tinkering with HTML during my senior year in High School making basic pages. Then at the University of Florida, I spent quite a few hours pouring over <i>Head First Java</i>, learning programming fundamentals while pursuing a digital arts degree. I also learned a little 3d modeling while I was there. Fast forward ten years, I'm back to coding, having championed UCF's coding bootcamp and learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, JQuery, SQL and more!</p><br>
                
                <p>In the interim between studying Java at UF and now, I switched majors to Japanese Language and Literature, and launched down a totally different career path. I studied abroad in Japan for a year, then came home and earned my Bachelors of Arts from UF. After college, I became a firefighter/paramedic for Marion County, Florida for 5 years. I then earned an Associate of Science Degree in Nursing and worked as a Critical Care Registered Nurse for 3 years.</p><br>

                <p>I also enjoy playing guitar, creative writing, riding my bicycle, reading comic books, real books, and manga. Also, long walks on the beach.</p>
